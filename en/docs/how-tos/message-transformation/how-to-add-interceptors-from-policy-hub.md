# How to add interceptors from Policy Hub

In this guide we will see how we can engage a shared interceptor using [Policy Hub](https://docs.wso2.com/display/MG310/The+Policy+Hub) ., in three simple steps. First check our [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.wso2.com/display/MG310/Quick+Start+Guide+-+Binary) to undestand the basic commands of Microgateway.

## Initialize and setup a Microgateway Project.

Run below command to initialize a new microgateway project with an openapi definition.

**Init Project**

``` bash
    micro-gw init petstore -a https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wso2/product-microgateway/v3.0.4/samples/petstore_basic.yaml
```

    ## Include the extensions in the OpenAPI definitions using the policy sharing syntax

    Now we have a project initilized for petstore API. Next step is to add required extensions to engage the interceptors from Policy hub. For this we can use `         x-wso2-request-interceptor        ` and `         x-wso2-response-interceptor        ` extensions. To see complete usage details of these extensions, check [Adding Interceptors](https://docs.wso2.com/display/MG310/Adding+Interceptors) .

    1.  Open the `          petstore_basic.yaml         ` inside `          petstore/api_definitions         ` directory.
    2.  Before `           x-wso2-basePath: /petstore/v1          ` extension, add `           x-wso2-request-interceptor: prasadhi/Interceptors/0.1.0:validateRequest          `

    !!! info
    Interceptor reference should be provided in following format.
    `           <ballerina_org>/<ballerina_module>/<ballerina_module_version>:<interceptor_function>          ` .
    If version is not provided, latest version of the specified module will be engaged.

## Build and run Microgateway Project

Lets build and run the project to see if new interceptors are working.

1.  Build the petstore project.

    **Build Project**

    ``` bash
        micro-gw build petstore
    ```

        2.  Start the gateway.

        **Run Gateway**

    ``` bash
        gateway <project_path>/target/petstore.jar
    ```

        3.  Send a request to petstore API. This request should fail since we don't mention the required header X-API-Key which is validated inside theÂ prasadhi/Interceptors:validateRequest interceptor.

        **Wrong Request**

    ``` bash
        curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -X GET https://localhost:9095/petstore/v1/pet/1
    ```

        4.  Now send the correct request to see if it gives the correct response

        **Correct Request**

    ``` bash
        curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-API-Key: apikey-value" -X GET https://localhost:9095/petstore/v1/pet/1
    ```

        Thats how you could configure Microgateway to use shared interceptors through Policy Hub. To see more detailed information on this feature checkout the feature documentation at [The Policy Hub](https://docs.wso2.com/display/MG310/The+Policy+Hub) .
